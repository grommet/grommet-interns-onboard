        <Paragraph size="large">
          One of Grommet's core tenants is Accessibility. In Grommet we aim for
          inclusive design that provide equal access and equal opportunity to
          people with diverse abilities. Access to information and
          communications technologies, including the Web, is defined as a basic
          human right and we thrive to comply it and be an inclusive component
          library.

          Web Accessibility has many different layers had accessibility supports
          in terms of visual impaired users, screen readers, keyboard navigation
          and more. The developer intern will dive into this accessibility
          world, and the WCAG standards and bring the Grommet component library
          closer to those standards and accessibility expectations.

          components will benefit the library greatly. This process begins by
          researching and diving head first into development tools to real-time
          inspect the web pages and components, learn any accessibility caveats
          that may exist in the framework and ultimately get them resolved.
          Learning more about accessibility standards and improving upon them in
          Grommet will allow Amanda to build a foundation of knowledge and
          comfort within the framework.
