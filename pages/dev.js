          As I begin my internship at HPE, I have a lot of exciting projects and 
          learning opportunities to look forward to this summer and beyond. One of
          the first things I will be working on is the continuous improvement of 
          accessibility across {
            <Anchor href="https://github.com/grommet/grommet">Grommet</Anchor>
          } components. This process begins by researching and diving head first 
          into development tools to real-time inspect the web pages and 
          components I will be contributing to and building.
