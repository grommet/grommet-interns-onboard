          You should have received your Mac and will be receiving a YubiKey
          soon. This little YubiKey is a device that will allow you to access
          the HPE Intranet. Once we have your HPE email up and running on your
          Mac, we will be able to get your YubiKey configured, as well as the
          rest of your environment set up. This can take some time and you’ll
          have other tasks related to the HPE Internship program and HPE
          training as you get started.
