          We are excited to have you join our team! HPE is one of the most
          dynamic, industry-leading companies in the technology world, with
          ample opportunities for growth and a relentless commitment to being
          the best at everything we do. HPE has developed an onboarding program
          designed to prepare you for success in your internship. Your virtual
          intern orientation class is where you will meet fellow interns, and
          learn about strategies for success in your HPE internship, as well as
          receive information about the many useful resources at HPE.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          The orientation will be mostly focused on PC setup. Since the HPE
          Experience Studio is mostly using Mac, some of the instructions might
          not be relevant for you and you'll have to use other resources to go
          through the Set Up process successfully. Do not contact HPE IT with
          questions, since they do not support Mac.

          You should have received your Mac and will be receiving a YubiKey
          soon. This little YubiKey is a device that will allow you to access
          the HPE Intranet. You will need to download the HPE Yubikey DigitalBadge
          application. If this application is not on your device upon initial launch, 
          you will need to contact Aruba support to recieve and install the software 
          from them. Once your Yubikey is configured, we will be able to get your HPE 
          email, as well as the rest of your environment properly set up. This can 
          take some time and you’ll have other tasks related to the HPE Internship 
          program and HPE training as you get started.

        <Paragraph>
          You'll be invited to a 'PC Set-Up Training'. The PC setup training
          will only be partially relevant to your setup since you'll be using 
          a Mac, and those calls are generally for Windows-based computers. 
          However, they may provide instructions for students using their own 
          computers (BYOD - Bring our Own Device), or for Aruba interns that 
          will be using a Mac, so it might be relevant, and you might find 
          that useful so stay tuned.
